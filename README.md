# E-levy-calculator
This was created using C++ to calculate how much tax (the precise amount deducted) is placed on each electronic transaction, as implemented in Ghana by the Ghanaian law. This calculator does not implement taxes imposed by service providers (MTN, Vodafone, etc). It only calculates the 1.5% imposed by the government.
